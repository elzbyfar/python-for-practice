# Let's write a simple real estate program. 

# 1. The program opens by telling the user what options are available. Print the locations where there are current openings. Don't hard code the information, challenge yourself to extract the location names from the dictionary. 


# asking the user where they would like to search for a home. 

# Next, ask the user how many bedrooms they will be would like to have in their home. 

# With those two pieces of information, calculate the total mortgage. To get the total mortgage, multiply the location's property tax by the amount of bedrooms desired. 

# Finally, ask the user if they have good, average or bad credit. If they have good credit, they need to put 10% down. If they have average credit, they need to put 15% down. Otherwise they need to put 20% down. 








# bedroom_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# 
# for key,val in current_openings_and_property_taxes.items():
#   print(key, val)


# total_mortgage = 0
# down_payment_percentage = 0
# down_payment_in_dollars = 0

# 1) Write a function called season_teller that takes a number corresponding to a month (1-12) and prints the season that is in effect during that month. If the that month observes a season change, print the season that is in effect at the start of the month as well as information about when the season will change. 

# Example: if the number is:

    # 5 ==> "It's Spring."
    # 8 ==> "Summer"
    # 6 ==> "June marks the end of Spring and the beginning of Summer with the Summer Solstice, Saturday, June 20, 2020, 5:44 p.m."
    # 13 ==> "Theres no 13th month, please enter a number 1-12"

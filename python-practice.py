# Practice Questions:

# 1. Write a program that takes an array of numbers (also known as a list of numbers) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. Write the code inside a function. 

# property_tax_by_location_per_year = {
#   "NYC": 10000, 
#   "Englewood": 7000, 
#   "San Antonio": 2000
# }

# bedroom_count = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# total_mortgage = 0
# down_payment_percentage = 0
# down_payment_in_dollars = 0

# 2. Let's write a simple real estate program. The program opens by asking the user how many bedrooms Make sure your program tells users how much their down payment will be depending on their credit. If they have good credit, they need to put 10% down. If they have average credit, they need to put 15% down. Otherwise they need to put 20% down. 





# my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

# my_list.insert(2, 5)

# print(my_list)
